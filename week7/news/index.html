        <p>The astounding sums of money shelled out last week in the city’s sale of 200 yellow taxi medallions prove that New York is ready for a cab revolution that can benefit both drivers and riders.</p>
        <p>People eager to get into the taxi business, or expand on what they already have, paid an average of more than $1.1 million to outfit each car with the licenses necessary to pick up passengers.</p>
        <p>They ponied up because they know that the taxi industry has been doing super and they expect it to keep doing so, making such an investment highly profitable.</p>
        <p>That’s the case even though the Bloomberg administration has begun green-car street-hail service in the boroughs and northern Manhattan, areas that the yellows rarely serve. Predictions that economic doom would follow if the yellows lost an absolute monopoly on street hails were bunk.</p>
        <p>Still more important, the new medallions will put 200 wheelchair-accessible cabs on the streets.</p>
        <p>At present, only 231 of the city’s 13,237 yellow cabs can accommodate wheelchairs, a measly 1.7%. Facing federal litigation by advocates for people with disabilities, Mayor Bloomberg has resisted boosting that number substantially, part of his argument being that the specially equipped vehicles would be prohibitively expensive.</p>
        <p>That, too, now stands as bunk. An additional cost of, say, $15,000 per cab is negligible when medallions are going for upwards of $1.1 million.</p>
        <p>After the 200 new cabs hit the streets, slightly more than 3% of the fleet will be wheelchair accessible. A tiny improvement.</p>
        <p>Following that, there will be another TLC baby step with the planned auction of 200 additional medallions for accessible cabs. When those vehicles start rolling, it will still mean that fewer than 1 in 20 will accommodate wheelchairs.</p>
        <p>Finally, state legislation could eventually allow the city to auction off another 1,600 accessible medallions (for a total of 2,000). If that ever happens, the accessible percentage wouldn’t even break 15%, about 1 in 7. Hardly equitable to persons with disabilities.</p>
        <p>There has to be more. Going down that road, the Taxi and Limousine Commission under Mayor Bloomberg and his elected successor Bill de Blasio should phase in ever more wheelchair accessible cabs and should reach a court settlement that commits to vastly more equal cab service for those who get around in wheelchairs.</p>
