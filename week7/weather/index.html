        <p>Denver will enjoy high temperatures of 64 degrees Tuesday and 61 on Wednesday, before things get ugly - with possibly 3 inches of snow and temperatures in the teens for the back end of the work week, according to the National Weather Service.</p>
        <p>The weather will take a turn Wednesday night. After an unseasonably warm afternoon, the city has a 60 percent chance of precipitation in the evening.</p>
        <p>The timing of the approaching moisture from the west and cold front from the south is key, so forecasters said Tuesday that Denver could accumulate from 1 to 3 inches of snow as temperatures fall into the 20s before midnight.</p>
        <p>The metro area has a 60 percent chance of snow Thursday, when the high is excepted to top out at 27 degrees - or 22 degrees colder than normal for the date.</p>
        <p>The average high temperature for the date is 50 degrees, and 49 on Thursday, according to weather records.</p>
        <p>A 40 percent chance of snow lingers until about 11 p.m. Thursday, but forecasters have not yet estimated the total accumulation for both days.</p>
        <p>High temperatures are predicted to be in the 30s on Friday and Saturday, before temperatures rebound to about 50 degrees on Sunday and Monday.</p>
        <p>So far this month, Denver has been about 3.1 degrees warmer than normal each day, and the city has gotten a total of only 9.03 inches of precipitation, which is .38 inches below normal for this point in the mouth, weather records indicate.</p>
        <p>Scattered snow is expected to develop in the mountains Tuesday afternoon and leave about 2 inches overnight at higher elevations, according to the National Weather Service.</p>
        <p>Warmer temperatures below 9,000 feet could allow only rain in most of western Colorado Wednesday, as moisture approaches from the west and collides with colder temperatures over the Front Range and plains that evening, forecasters said.</p>
        <p>“The deep tap of moisture will be diminishing by that time and the potential for heavy snowfall is expected to decrease.” the National Weather Service in Grand Junction stated on its website Tuesday. “There is still some uncertainty on potential snow amounts with this storm.”</p>
        <p>Steamboat Springs is expected to pick up only about an inch of snow Wednesday night and lighter amounts on Thursday, but Aspen could accumulate up to 4 inches Wednesday, with a 50 percent chance of snow Thursday, forecasters said.</p>
        <p>Durango is expected to get rain on Wednesday, about an inch of snow Wednesday night, then chances for rain and snow linger until Saturday with forecast highs in the 40s each day.</p>
