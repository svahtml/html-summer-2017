        <h2>Lady Gaga to close out New York City’s famed Roseland Ballroom</h2>

        <p>Lady Gaga will lead the last dance at Roseland Ballroom with a string of special shows starting Mar. 28. Reports first circulated back in October that the legendary midtown venue would close by early 2014. But the Gaga announcement offers the first official confirmation of the shuttering.</p>
        <p>End of an Era: Gaga’s four shows - the 3,500-capacity venue’s final concerts - will take place between Mar. 28 and Apr. 2, 2014. Roseland has been at its current site since 1956.</p>
        <p>Gaga plans to play four shows at the 3,500-capacity venue: Mar. 28, 30, 31 and Apr. 2. Tickets go on sale Monday, Nov. 25, at 10 a.m. Prices range from $50 for general admission floor access to $200 for the mezzanine.</p>
        <p>Roseland has operated at various times in the city since it opened in 1919, in a space located right around the corner from its current location on 52nd St., west of Broadway. The ballroom ascended with the upswing of jazz in the ’20s and ’30s, hosting shows by Louis Armstrong, Count Basie (who had a song called “Roseland Shuffle”), Harry James, Tommy Dorsey and Glenn Miller.</p>
        <p>Roseland became known for dancing as far back as the ’40s, rather notoriously for its “dance marathons,” a trend depicted in the movie “They Shoot Horses, Don’t They?” The club moved to its current location in 1956, after the original structure was torn down. In the ’70s, Roseland hosted disco nights and later became a venue for big pop names to play special, smaller shows, from the Rolling Stones to Madonna to Beyonce.</p>
        <p>Rumors have circulated about the venue’s demise ever since 1996, when owner Laurence Ginsberg filed plans to tear down its low-rise, three-story structure to be replaced by a 42-story high-rise. But shows continued to be booked right through the early part of 2014.</p>
        <p>The first of Gaga’s closing performances, on Mar. 28, will coincide with her 28th birthday.</p>
