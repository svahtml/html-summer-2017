		<p><strong>LOS ANGELES</strong> - The animated comedy "<em>Cars</em>" raced to first place at the weekend box office with a $62.8 million debut, maintaining the <a href="http://www.pixar.com">Disney-Pixar</a> cartoon brand's undefeated record with a seventh straight hit.</p>

		<p>If the numbers hold when final figures come out Monday, "Cars" would have the third-best opening in the Disney-Pixar cartoon series, just ahead of "Monsters, Inc." but behind "The Incredibles" and "Finding Nemo," which both debuted at about $70 million.</p>

		<p>Still, it was the first time since the partnership began with 1995's "Toy Story" that a Disney-Pixar film did not gross more than its predecessor over opening weekend.</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>"I look at $62 million as being an accomplishment of great proportion," said Chuck Viane, Disney's head of distribution. "I think to use the baseball analogy, a home run is a home run in anybody's ballpark, whether it's 398 feet or 460 feet. This is a home run."</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>The movie features the voices of Owen Wilson and Paul Newman in a story of a hotshot race car that gets a lesson on the value of slowing down when he's sidetracked in a sleepy burgh.</p>

		<p>The weekend's other new wide release, 20th Century Fox's horror remake "The Omen," was No. 4 with $15.45 million. Starring Julia Stiles and Liev Schreiber in the tale of a demon child, "The Omen" has grossed $35.7 million since opening on Tuesday to take advantage of the date - 6-6-06 - a play on the number signifying the anti-Christ.</p>
